          <p>At the beginning of its existence, the Louvre replenished its funds at the expense of the royal collections collected at the time by Francis I and Louis XIV. At the time of the founding of the museum, the royal collection consisted of exactly 2,500 paintings.<br><br>Gradually, the most valuable paintings of the royal collection were transferred to the museum collection. A huge number of sculptures came from the Museum of French Sculpture and after numerous confiscations of property during the revolution. <br><br>During the Napoleonic Wars, at the suggestion of the first director of the museum, Baron Denon, the Louvre collection was replenished with military trophies, at the same time archaeological finds from Egypt and the Middle East enter the museum. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the museum's collection was replenished as a result of many acquisitions and gifts, among the latest - the collection of Edmund Rothschild, which the museum inherited under the will of the latter.</p>
